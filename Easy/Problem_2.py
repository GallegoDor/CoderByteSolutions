#Task 2 - The instructions that were given are below
#2. Have the function FirstFactorial(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it 
#(ie. if num = 4, return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)). For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18. 

import math
def FirstFactorial(num): 
  return math.factorial(num)

# keep this function call here  
# to see how to enter arguments in Python scroll down
print FirstFactorial(raw_input())
